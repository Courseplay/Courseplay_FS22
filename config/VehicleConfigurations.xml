This file is used to customize Courseplay for specific vehicles and implements.

Typically you'd include a vehicle/implement here if it needs some special treatment
to work correctly with Courseplay. For instance, some implements are offset to the
left or right side (like bale loaders), so when doing fieldwork, you want do drive
on the left or right of the actual course so the bale loader's pickup is aligned
with the course.

This file is the global configuration coming with your copy of Courseplay. If you
want your own vehicle config, you can create a file called
vehicleConfigurations.xml in your modsSettings/Courseplay folder. Settings defined
in that file will override the settings defined here.

You can use the cpReadVehicleConfigurations console command to reload these files
in-game.

Custom settings are listed per vehicle, the vehicle is identified by its XML file
name (you can find this in the game's folder under data/vehicles/<make>/<model>/

A vehicle may have multiple implements attached. If multiple implements have the
same attribute defined here, Courseplay just uses the first value it finds, which
can be any of the multiple values.

You can define the following custom settings:

- toolOffsetX: number
    Offset of the tool's centerline relative to the course, left +, right -.
    For example, if your tool is 2 meters right use "-2.0" here.

- noReverse: boolean
    This implement can't be reversed. Will not use any turn maneuvers which needs
    reversing.

- turnRadius: number
    Override the turn radius configured by the vehicle author or calculated by
    Courseplay and use this value instead, in meters.

- workingWidth: number
	Working width (in meters) to use instead of the width calculated from the vehicle/implement
	data. Courseplay uses the AI markers, or if the do not exist, the work areas to determine the
	working width. Some tools, especially folding plows also fold their markers and work areas,
	preventing us from getting the correct length.

- balerUnloadDistance: number
    Able to set the distance to the waiting point when it needs to unload. Used by bale loaders.
    Distance from trailer's turning point to the rear unloading point in meters.

- directionNodeOffsetZ:	number
	If set, then the Direction Node will be offset by this value in meters. (Only usable for Enterables)

- implementWheelAlwaysOnGround:	boolean
    Implements that have the topReferenceNode set, but still have the wheels on the ground all the time.
    In general, set this to true for implements which have a wheel and looked like any towed implement
    but are attached to the tractor with the 3 point hitch (and not the tow hitch).

- ignoreCollisionBoxesWhenFolded: boolean
	This is for the case where the collision boxes of the vehicle are very wide, for example
    a sprayer's box is as wide as the extended sprayer arms. This works on the field but will cause conflict when
    the vehicle drives with folded sprayer for instance on an unload course.
	For this scenario the collision box is useless when folded, so when ignoreCollisionBoxesOnStreet is true,
    Courseplay will not detect collisions for this vehicle when it is folded.

- baleCollectorOffset: number
	Offset in meters to use in bale collector mode (Mode 7). This is the distance between the tractor's centerline
	and the edge of the bale when the bale grabber is right where it should be to pick up the bale.
	Courseplay will adjust this offset according to the bale's dimensions but you may want to add a little buffer.

- raiseLate: boolean
    The default behavior is to raise the implement when the front of the work area reaches the end of the row or
    the field edge. This works great for rectangular shaped work areas but with other shapes (like a plow) it may
    lead to unworked patches. With this setting true, Courseplay will wait until the end of the work area reaches
    the field edge or row end before raising the implements.

- lowerEarly: boolean
    Similar to the above, the default behavior when starting to work is lower the implement when the back of the
    work area reaches to row start/field edge. Setting this to true will make Courseplay lowere the implement as
    soon as the the front reaches the row start/field edge, avoiding unworked patches with irregular implement
    work areas such as a plow.

- modName: Name of the .zip file (without '.zip')
    In case a Mod has the same .xml filename for the vehicle/implement, as a default giants vehicle/implement,
    add the name of the .zip file to prevent conflicts. For example: "FS22_exampleMod".
    Note: Only 2 of the same .xml files can be added.
