**[Download the latest developer version](https://github.com/Courseplay/Courseplay_FS22/releases/latest)** (the file FS22_Courseplay.zip).

## Multiplayer support with Version 7.0.1.0 or higher!

## What Works

* Course generation
* Field work with generated courses
* Refill or unload with [AutoDrive](https://github.com/Stephan-S/FS22_AutoDrive)
* Combine self unload
* Wrap and collect bales with or without a course
* Save/load/rename/move courses
* Create custom fields with recording or drawing on the AI Map
* Vehicle Convoy

## Usage

There is now a CP Fieldwork job available on the AI helper screen. Just with the built in helper, you can select a target position. When you start the job,
the helper will drive to this position before starting the fieldwork. Use the Field position to tell the helper which field you want them to work on.
Once you selected a valid Field position, you can click on the CP Open/Close Course Generator button on the bottom of the screen to open the course generator and generate a course.
If your vehicle is already near or on the field, you can use the HUD or a keyboard shortcut to start the CP helper at the first, nearest or last waypoint of the fieldwork course.

## Turning on Debug Channels

When there's an issue, you can turn on debug logging on the Courseplay vehicle settings page for each vehicle. This will
enable loggin debug information for that vehicle only. Devs need those logs when troubleshooting and fixing bugs.
 
What information is logged when you activated the debug logging for the vehicle depends on the active debug channels. This
are similar to those we had in CP 19, but the way to turn them on/off is different: you can bring up the debug channel menu 
by pressing Shift+4, then use Shift+1 and Shift+3 to select a channel, and then Shift+2 to toggle the selected debug channel 
(green is on).

Remember, you have to activate debug mode for the vehicle in the vehicle settings page, otherwise nothing is logged, even if
the channel is active.

## Developer version

Please be aware you're using a developer version, which may and will contain errors, bugs, mistakes and unfinished code. Chances are you computer will explode when using it. Twice. If you have no idea what "beta", "alpha", or "developer" means and entails, steer clear. The Courseplay team will not take any responsibility for crop destroyed, savegames deleted or baby pandas killed.

You have been warned.

If you're still ok with this, please remember to post possible issues that you find in the developer version. That's the only way we can find sources of error and fix them.
Be as specific as possible:

* tell us the version number
* only use the vehicles necessary, not 10 other ones at a time
* which vehicles are involved, what is the intended action?
* Post! The! Log! to [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) or [PasteBin](http://pastebin.com/)
* For more details on how to post a proper bug report, visit our [Wiki](https://github.com/Courseplay/Courseplay_FS22/wiki)
