	- Sending the fieldwork driver to refill seeds/fertilizers and so on.
	- Sending the fieldworker/ bale collector to unload collected straw and so on.

If you prefer videos, YouTube has many great [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=courseplay+fs22)

## Turning on Debug Channels

When there's an issue, you can turn on debug logging on the Courseplay vehicle settings page for each vehicle. This will
enable logging of debug information for only this vehicle. **Devs need those logs for troubleshooting and fixing bugs.**
 
What information is logged when you activated the debug logging for the vehicle depends on the active debug channels. This
are similar to those we had in CP 19, but the way to turn them on/off is different: you can bring up the debug channel menu 
by pressing Shift+4, then use Shift+1 and Shift+3 to select a channel, and then Shift+2 to toggle the selected debug channel 
(green is on).

Remember, you have to activate debug mode for the vehicle in the vehicle settings page, otherwise nothing is logged, even if
the channel is active.

## Developer version

Please be aware you're using a developer version, which may and will contain errors, bugs, mistakes and unfinished code. Chances are you computer will explode when using it. Twice. If you have no idea what "beta", "alpha", or "developer" means and entails, steer clear. The Courseplay team will not take any responsibility for crop destroyed, savegames deleted or baby pandas killed.

You have been warned.

If you're still ok with this, please remember to post possible issues that you find in the developer version. That's the only way we can find sources of error and fix them.
Be as specific as possible:

* tell us the version number
* only use the vehicles necessary, not 10 other ones at a time
* which vehicles are involved, what is the intended action?
* Post! The! Log! to [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) or [PasteBin](http://pastebin.com/)
* For more details on how to post a proper bug report, visit our [Wiki](https://github.com/Courseplay/Courseplay_FS22/wiki)
