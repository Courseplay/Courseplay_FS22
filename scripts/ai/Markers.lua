    These markers can be added to a vehicle:
        - front marker node:
            - moved all the way to the front of the vehicle or the front most attached implement.
        - back marker node:
            - moved all the way to the back of the vehicle or the rear most attached implement.

        - front marker offset:
            - distance between the vehicle root node and the front maker node (positive)
        - back marker offset:
            - distance between the vehicle root node and the back maker node (negative)
