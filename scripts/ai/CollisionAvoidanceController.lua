--- The collision avoidance controller implements a simple algorithm to prevent an unloader
--- from crossing a combine's path and potentially colliding with it or blocking its way.
---
--- The controller checks if the own vehicle's course intersects with any active CP combine's course.
--- If they are, and the estimated arrival times of the combine and the own vehicle at that point are
--- within eteDiffThreshold seconds, the controller activates the collision avoidance warning.

-- differ in less than eteDiffThreshold

-- Warnings are cleared clearWarningDelayMs milliseconds after the controller detects
-- that there is no collision danger anymore. This is to allow the combine to move past
-- the collision point as the controller works with the current waypoints of the vehicles,
-- which are the waypoints in front of the vehicle.
