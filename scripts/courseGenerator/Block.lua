--- A block is an area in the center of the field which can
--- be covered by one set of alternating up/down rows, simply
--- turning 180 at the row end into the next row.
---
--- Regular rectangular or simple convex fields will always have
--- just one block. More complex shapes may require splitting
--- the area into multiple blocks, depending on the row angle.
