--- Pathfinder controller context
--------------------------------------------

PathfinderContext implements all pathfinder parameters.
        - Other Context Classes could be derived for commonly used contexts.
        - Only the attributesToDefaultValue table has to be changed in the derived class.

Example usage of the builder api:

local context = PathfinderContext():maxFruitPercent(100):useFieldNum(10):vehiclesToIgnore({vehicle})
